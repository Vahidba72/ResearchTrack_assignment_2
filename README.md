# Research_Track1_Second_Assignment 

The second assignment of Research track consists of development of a package that interacts with a simulation of a simple robot in Gazebo. This assignment is designed to work as a ROS (Robot Operating System) node to control a robot's navigation system. The package contains three nodes:

Node A: A node that implements an action client, allowing the user to set a target (x, y) or to cancel it. Try to use the  feedback/status of the action server to know when the target has been reached. The node also publishes the
robot position and velocity as a custom message (x,y, vel_x, vel_z), by relying on the values published on the
topic /odom;


Node B: A service node that, when called, returns the coordinates of the last target sent by the user;


Node C: Another service node that subscribes to the robot's position and velocity (using the custom message) and
implements a server to retrieve the distance of the robot from the target and the robot's average speed.

Also create a launch file to start the whole simulation. Use a parameter to select the size of the averaging window of node (c)


# Documentation
----------------------

To clone the code and the whole package from the github repository into a ROS workspace, use the following line of code in your terminal (clone it into a ROS workspace). Also in the link given you can find the documentation about the code.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Vahidba72/ResearchTrack_assignment_2
```

# Package Structure

- **`src` Directory:**
  
    - `go_to_point_service.py`: Node that makes the robot move to a specified location.
    - `wall_follow_service.py`: Node that makes the robot move forward to reach a wall and then keep following the wall until it passes the wall
    - `bug_as.py`: Node implementing an algorithm to reach a goal by combinig the go_to_point and wall_follow algorithms and changing between these two cases
    - `my_node_A.py`: Manages the robot's position and velocity, Allows dynamic changes and cancellations of goals, and Publishes the robot's position and velocity on a custom message type.
    - `my_node_B.py`: Node offering a service to retrieve the last target coordinates entered by the user.
    - `my_node_C.py`: Offers a service to calculate and provide the average distance and velocity of the robot based on its position and velocity information and the window defined in the launch file.
    
  - `CMakeLists.txt`: Configuration file for building the package which contains all the other packages and dependencies that this package has.
  - `package.xml`: Package manifest file.

- **`msg` Directory:**
  - `Vel.msg`: Custom ROS message structure definition for representing the robot's position and velocity.

- **`srv` Directory:**
  - `LastTarget.srv`: ROS service definition for retrieving the last entered target coordinates.
  - `Average.srv`: ROS service definition for calculating and providing the distance to the target and average velocity.

- **`launch` Directory:**
  - `assignment1.launch`: ROS launch file executing the various nodes and parameters needed for simulation.


## Custom Message

- **`Vel.msg`**
  - Represents the robot's position and velocity structure for the custom message.
  - Fields:
    - `x`: x-coordinate of the robot's position.
    - `y`: y-coordinate of the robot's position.
    - `vel_x`: linear velocity of the robot in the x-axis.
    - `vel_z`: angular velocity of the robot in the z-axis.

## Custom Services

- **`LastTarget.srv`**
  - ROS service structure for the last entered target coordinates by the user.
  - Fields:
    - `target_x`: x-coordinate of the last target entered.
    - `target_y`: y-coordinate of the last target entered.

- **`Average.srv`**
  - ROS service structure that calculates and provides the average distance and velocity of the robot based on average window.
  - Fields:
    - `dist`: Distance between the robot and the target to be reached.
    - `velocity_mean`: Mean velocity of the robot.

## Launch File

- **`assignment1.launch`**
  - The execution of various nodes for simulation.
  - Simulation parameters like the target x and y nad also the size of the averaging window.
  - Configures the simulation environment.
  - Launches nodes for wall following, point navigation, bug algorithm, and custom nodes for position, target retrieval, and average calculations.

## Usage

1. Ensure that ROS is installed on your system.
2. Build the package using `catkin_make`.
3. Customize the parameters in `assignment1.launch` based on your requirements.
4. Before starting the simulation, make sure to make all the python codes in the script to be executables by running the following code in your terminal:
   ```bash
   $ chmod +x name_of_the_file.py
   ```
6. Run the launch file using `roslaunch your_package_name assignment1.launch`.

# Coding
----------------------

## my_node_A ##

### Functions

1. **publish_kinematics**
   - Subscribes to the `/odom` topic to obtain the current position and velocity of the robot.
   - Publishes the robot's position and velocity on the `/kinematics` topic using a custom message type named `Vel`.

2. **Goal Management:**
   - Initializes an action client for reaching goals.
   - Prompts the user to change the goal or cancel the movement.
   - Retrieves the current target from parameters in the launch file.
   - Allows the user to set new goals dynamically and sends the updated goal for action execution.
   - Cancels the current goal if requested.

### Parameters

- `/des_pos_x`: Parameter for the desired x-coordinate of the goal position.
- `/des_pos_y`: Parameter for the desired y-coordinate of the goal position.

### Usage

During runtime, the node will prompt the user to change the goal or cancel the movement. Enter "Change" to set a new goal dynamically or "Cancel" to stop the movement. The goal should be cancelled first every time we need to change it. The chosen or updated goal, as well as the robot's position and velocity, will be logged.

## my_node_B ##

### Functions

1. **Service Implementation:**
   - Implements the `last_target` service to provide the last entered target coordinates.
   - Retrieves the values of `/des_pos_x` and `/des_pos_y` parameters and sets them as the response to the service call.
   - Prints a message indicating the start of the service.

### Parameters

- `/des_pos_x`: Parameter for the desired x-coordinate of the goal position.
- `/des_pos_y`: Parameter for the desired y-coordinate of the goal position.

### Usage

The node will log a message indicating that it is ready to provide the last target coordinates. The service can be called from other nodes or services to retrieve the last entered target coordinates.

## my_node_C ##

### Functionality

1. **Service Implementation:**
   - Implements the `average` service to calculate and provide the average distance and velocity of the robot.
   - Retrieves the last entered target coordinates from the `last_target` service.
   - Subscribes to the `/kinematics` topic to obtain the current position and velocity of the robot.
   - Calculates the distance to the last target and maintains a list of velocities for averaging.

2. **Average Calculation:**
   - Calculates the Euclidean distance to the last target.
   - Maintains a list of velocities and calculates the average velocity over a defined window.

### Parameters

- `/average_window`: Parameter defining the size of the window for calculating the average velocity.

## Usage

The node will log a message indicating that it is ready to calculate the average. The service can be called from other nodes or services to obtain the calculated average distance and velocity.
